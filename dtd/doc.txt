This project was developed by Luca Mannella for the Assignment 1 of the course Distributed Programming II in Politechnic University of Turin.

My DTD is an implementation of a Workflow Management System.
In our system we have a workflow that is a representation of a set of actions that an actor can perform.
The workflow is characterized by an ID field called name, which uniquely identifies it, and a set of actions.
Every action has a name, which must be unique within the workflow, and is associated with a role.
There are two different types of actions: simple actions and process actions.
Simple actions have a pointer (IDREFS) to a set of actions that could be performed by the actor that has perform that particular action.
A process action corresponds to the execution of a whole process; they are characterized by a pointer (IDREF) to the name of the nested workflow that they execute.
